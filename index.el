;; I find (c/e)tags to be really useful when navigating projects of
;; almost any size. This file contains a few functions that improve
;; the way I prefer use TAGS.
;;
;;   * Jump to any definition in the project (using ido)
;;   * Jump to any definition in the currently opened buffer (using ido)
;;   * Open any file in the current project (using ido)
;;   * (TODO) Complete word at point (code-completion) (using ido)
;;
;; Most of the above listed functions are supported by etags out of
;; the box, but the functions below uses some conventions that makes
;; using tags so much more enjoyable (IMO).
;;
;;   * A project is defined by having a .gitignore file
;;   * When indexing your project it will skip any folders that are
;;     excluded in your .gitignore file.
;;   * The entire index is re-built whenever you save a file. This
;;     might not be optimal if you work on large projects but
;;     from my experience it's very convenient.
;;   * (TODO) If the current buffer isn't part of the currently
;;     active tags-table it will clear all tags-related caches
;;     and load the tags-table that is associated wih the given
;;     file (this only happens if such a TAGS file exist)
;;
;; This configuration works well for me.
